These are all the dlls that are currently required to use my programs.
Most of people already have them.. but always there are the ones that dont :P

So..

*How to Install*

Copy all the dlls to the folder:

C:/Windows/System32

or to the same folder that the program is in


If it asks you to replace the files, 
first make a backup of the old one, 
and then you replace.
